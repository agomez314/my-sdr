# Homemade Software Defined Radio
This project follows the tutorials set up by [AC2CZ](https://www.g0kla.com/sdr/tutorials) to create my own software defined radio. The objective is to understand and implement the basic components that make up SDR and use the same to communicate with satellites using a basic ground station setup.

Long term, I'd be great if I could experiment with some of the newest packet protocols to transmit information in the GHz range across distances - and cut out the middleman along the way (ISP provider/cloud hosting services).
